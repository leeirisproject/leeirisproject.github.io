        <li>Something that I learned from this article is that there are a lot of nuances in designing and you have to place yourself in the place of the consumer. Furthermore
            designing is not an innate ability but rather something built through observations and practice.
        </li>
        <li>Favorite part of the article is how they breakdown each popular app and show what they did to for what effect. I also like how they listed out the elements of design.</li>
        <li>"How does the design guide your focus? What information is highlighted? How does color and text treatment signal the importance of certain elements?"</li>
