					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is the importance of design in terms of being accesible. Normally as I browse the web, I never consider how some people with disabilities manage the same tasks. I also learned the different ways to create more accesible to people such as increasing contrast, adding textures, and using more text descriptions. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is the bullet points highlighting the different acts and lawsuits that are involved. It not only provided evidence but also shows that accesibility has been a constant issue that new designers should all focus on these problems. Furthermore, I also like the humor they used in the article "don't be rude".</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
