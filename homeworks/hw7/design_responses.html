						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is how human mind percieves certain patterns and how that is specifically transfered into UI/UX design. For example, one this I learned is that human mind correlate two things that move in the same direction and this can be applied to UI/UX design in order to group things together. Through design methods such as symmetry, Continuation, Common Fate, Invariance, etc, people can use UI/UX design to convey what they would like. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is their examples of each subject which makes it easier to understand what you can implement to achieve the goal. Another part of the article that I like is the graphs because it helps represent what the reaction is. For example, the panda bear picture allowed you to realize ur brain imaged the rest of the image so you would be able to identify the image. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
