                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something that I learned from this article is the modern design of websites and apps. For example, sliding instead of button clicking and the sliding animations in order to grab attention. Another example is the how the the user experiences is easy and straight forward hence more modern. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is the graph the examples and animations of how each design moves. It showcases designs that people are used to and could intuitively use. my favorite part of the article is the color scheme based on the darkness and lightness of the site.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Some of my inspirations are is the Travel Map, Easy Grow, and Dark. I Think I liked these the most because te animations are visually satisfying. Furthermmore, the interface is straight forwards and utilize features that have been used before and can easily recognized. The color scheme of all three matches the shades that each try to represent. An example being, dark where the shades of colors are all tinted darker. In comparison to easy grow where the colors are light but vibrant.</p>
